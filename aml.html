			<p>Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets.</p>
			<p>We have signed an outsourcing agreement with compliance company which is at the cutting edge of reg. tech. –  <a href="https://ecompliance.ltd/" target="_blank" class="link">eCompliance</a>. And we are going to use their services from day one.</p>
			<p>Company complies with the following anti-money laundering regulations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO)</li>
				<li>Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance (DTROP)</li>
				<li>Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO)</li>
				<li>United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance (UNATMO)</li>
				<li>United Nations Sanctions Ordinance (UNSO)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Cyber-attacks in the financial services sector are becoming more frequent and widespread, according to Sector Views report by Regulator. This may facilitate financial crime and identity theft therefore the company has developed internal policies to comply with money laundering regulations and prevent any attempts for illegal activity.</p>
			<p>Company is using rules and procedures like AML policy, risk policy, IT systems which prevent such cases and monitor customer behavior and transactions. Company will maintain constant monitoring of illegal activity by fully cooperating with authorities and reporting all suspicious activity to Hong Kong authorities.</p>
			<p>All businesses, and particularly those involved in the exchange or transfer of large sums of money on a global basis, need to ensure they conduct thorough, ongoing due diligence to minimize their risk of being an accessory to bribery, corruption, or money laundering.</p>
			<p>To actively prevent these kind of actions, company’s AML procedures comply with all applicable requirements under  AMLO, DTROP,  OSCO, UNATMO, UNSO regulation regarding money laundering prevention.</p>
			<p>To maintain a tight control over these procedures Company hired a Certified (CAMS) AML officer who holds the position of Compliance Director and is a member of the Board of Directors.</p>
			<p>Company’s policy has a strong risk-mitigation approach (fraud prevention tools and customized risk rules) which helps to guarantee a compliance with all existing AML stipulations. All employees of company are obliged to receive AML training on commencement of their duties. The staff will be provided with a copy of these procedures including guidelines and education materials. Afterwards tested about its content before starting any client facing duties.</p>
			<p>AML policies are going to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls are in place to account for both changes in regulatory environment and business.</p>
